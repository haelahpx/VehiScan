Vehiscan is an advanced vehicle detection and license plate recognition system that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to monitor traffic, count vehicles, and identify license plates in real-time or from uploaded videos.

## Features

- 🚗 **Vehicle Detection**: Identifies cars, trucks, buses, and vans using YOLO object detection  
- 🔢 **Vehicle Counting**: Tracks vehicles across counting lines/zones with direction detection  
- 🚘 **License Plate Recognition**: Extracts and reads license plates using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)  
- 📊 **Statistics Collection**: Maintains counts by vehicle type and plates detected  
- ☁️ **Cloud Integration**: Uploads processed videos and data to AWS S3  
- 🎥 **Dual Processing Modes**:  
  - Real-time video stream processing  
  - Uploaded video file processing  

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Deep Learning**:  
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection  
  - SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for vehicle tracking  
- **OCR**: EasyOCR for license plate reading  
- **GUI**: Flet (Python framework for building interactive UIs)  
- **Cloud**: AWS S3 for data storage  
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg
